      "+ \"-nd\" will prevent downloading directories\n",

      "\n",
      "It is important, but not always necessary, to assert that the files stored on the USGS's servers are fully intact once downloaded to our cluster. We can assert that the files are in tact with high confidence by checking to make sure the \"checksum\" of the file matches once downloaded to BU.\n",

Unfortuantely, there isn't a built-in mechanism in this program to validate checksums, so we'll do this in a Bash loop and if statement."
